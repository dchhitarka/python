# Python Projects
This file contains all of my python projetcs.
Projects Available:
  1. Text Editor:
    This is a basic text editor which I created using python's tkinter module. This has basic functions like save a file, open  an existing file and close the app from file menu. I'll be working on it in the future to make advance features in it.
  2. Todo-List:
    This is another app developed using tkinter module. You can add and delete task which is what a todo list is for.
